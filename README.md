# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch

## Overview

Welcome to my implementation of an "Etch A Sketch" toy. 
This repository showcases my work on the 2nd JavaScript project as part of the Odin Project Foundations Course.

The assignment was to create a webpage with a 16x16 grid using flex-box and a button at the top that would cause a JavaScript prompt to ask for the grid size that would be generated in the existing space.

There were two extra credit tasks which I have also implemented:

- Multi-color feature to randomize the squares RGB value.

- Progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square.
